	// Place your snippets for json here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"VS code title color scheme": {
		"prefix": "wscolor",
		"body": [
			"\"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {",
			"\t\"titleBar.activeBackground\": \"$1\",",
			"\t\"titleBar.activeForeground\": \"$2\"",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "pick a color scheme for project"
	}
